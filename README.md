# Towards Realistic Project-Level Code Generation via Multi-Agent Collaboration and Semantic Architecture Modeling

ProjectGen is a multi-agent framework that decomposes projects into architecture design, skeleton generation, and code filling stages with iterative refinement and memory-based context management.

## ProjectGen

#### Installation

```
conda create -n projectgen python=3.9
conda activate projectgen
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### Usage

Open `src/utils.py` and fill in your OpenAI API key:

```
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your_openai_api_key_here"
```


Navigate to the `src` directory and run the main script:

```
cd src
python main.py --dataset=CodeProjectEval
```



## CodeProjectEval

To better reflect real-world project scenarios and support evaluation through executable test cases, we construct a new project-level code generation dataset, CodeProjectEval, which consists of 18 Python repositories covering a wide range of topics.

**The detailed information can be seen below.**

**Each repository is supplemented with:**

- **docs/PRD.md:** provides detailed descriptions of a software system’s functional and non-functional requirements, guiding subsequent design and development.
- **docs/UML_pyreverse.md:** UML class diagram and package diagram generated by Pyreverse.
- **docs/architecture_design.md:** the directory tree of the repository and descriptions for each
  source file, accompanied by summaries of the classes and functions they contain.
- **check_tests/:** to provide initial verification during the code generation process.
- **unit_tests/:** executed upon completion of code generation to evaluate the overall quality and functional correctness of the generated projects.
